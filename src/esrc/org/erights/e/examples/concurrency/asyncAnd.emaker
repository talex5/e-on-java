/**
 * The <tt>asyncAnd</tt> function keeps track of the asynchronous
 * resolution of a list of promises-for-booleans, returning a promise that
 * resolves to the conjunction (and) of these.
 * <ul>
 * <li>It resolves to true if each and every promise in the list resolves to
 *     true.
 * <li>If false is seen, it resolves to false.
 * <li>If a broken promise is seen, it resolves to the broken promise.
 * </ul>
 * As with the logical and (<tt>&&</tt>) operator, it stops with the first
 * false and it resolves to false (though this does not stop the computations
 * that will resolve the other promises).
 *
 * @param promises A list of promises that resolve to boolean.
 * @return A promise for the conjunction of the promises.
