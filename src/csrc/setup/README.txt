Help on installing and running E


* This is the E-core package, a stripped-down version of the E distribution
* with just the core language runtime. It has been packaged for Zero Install
* and should therefore not require any manual installation steps. It probably
* doesn't work on Windows.
*
* According to the web-site, "All licenses are Mozilla or Mozilla compatible
* open source licenses."

                         Installing E


E itself is a pure Java program, and so, if need be, can be manually
installed in a platform independent manner. The manual install lacks
some conveniences provided by the automatic installation -- like the
association of file extensions with launching behavior. However, the
automatic install and these conveniences are only available for some
platforms. (As of 0.8.9m through the present, only on MSWindows.) On
other platforms, the manual install is required.

On the platforms for which automatic install is currently supported,
it is not yet known to work reliably. If it doesn't work for you,
please report the problems to bugs-at-erights.org or
http://bugs.sieve.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=16380, including the
diagnostic information explained below under "Reporting Bugs". Then
you should proceed to the manual install.


                   Preparing to Install


This section applies for either the automatic or manual install.

Before you can install E, you must install a Java executable
compatible with Sun's JDK >= 1.3. Into a shell prompt,
type "java -version" to see your situation. Below, we will refer to
the name of your java executable as if it is bound to the shell
variable JAVACMD.

On MSWindows, we assume either the MSDOS Shell (available in Windows2K
or WindowsXP under
"Start Menu >> Programs >> Accessories >> Command Prompt") or Cygwin
bash shell. (The bash shell is preferred.) On all other platforms, we
assume a regular bash shell in a Unix-like environment. If a bash
shell is used, it must be a bash >= 2.01.

For example, in an MSDOS shell:
    C:\>set JAVACMD=java
    C:\>"%JAVACMD%" -version
    java version "1.4.1_02"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1_02-b06)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1_02-b06, mixed mode)
    C:\>

For example, in a bash or Cygwin shell:
    $ JAVACMD=java
    $ "$JAVACMD" -version
    java version "1.4.1_02"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1_02-b06)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1_02-b06, mixed mode)
    $ echo $BASH_VERSION
    2.05b.0(9)-release
    $

Unpack the E distribution into the directory you'd like it to live.
On MSWindows, we suggest "C:/Program Files/erights.org/". On *nix, if
you are installing for the system as a whole, we suggest
"/usr/local/e". For a personal install, we suggest "~/ehome". Below,
we will refer to this directory as if it is bound to the shell
variable EHOME.

Below, you should also replace
* <download-dir> with the directory into which you downloaded the E
  distribution.
* <platform> with the name for the platform you're installing on, as
  encoded into the name of the distribution file you're installing
  from. This is either "purej" for the pure Java install (which
  therefore doesn't contain SWT), or <osdir>-<machdir> for the
  names encoding your operating system and instruction set,
  respectively. For example, the platform name "linux-motif-x86"
  consists of the osdir "linux-motif" and the machdir "x86".
* <version> with the version of E you're installing, as encoded into
  the name of the distribution file you're installing from. For
  example, "0.8.22c".


For example, in an MSDOS Shell
    C:\>set EHOME=c:\Program Files\erights.org
    C:\>mkdir "%EHOME%"
    C:\>cd "%EHOME%"
    C:\Program Files\erights.org>
... unpack "<download-dir>\E-win32-x86-<version>.zip" into "%EHOME%" ...
    C:\Program Files\erights.org>

For example, in a Cygwin shell:
    $ EHOME=/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/erights.org/
    $ mkdir "$EHOME"
    $ cd "$EHOME"
    $ unzip -q "<download-dir>/E-win32-x86-<version>.zip"
    $

For example, in a *nix bash shell for a personal install:
    $ EHOME=~/ehome
    $ mkdir "$EHOME"
    $ cd "$EHOME"
    $ tar xzf <download-dir>/E-<platform>-<version>.tar.gz
    $

For example, in a *nix bash shell for a system install:
    # EHOME=/usr/local/e
    # mkdir "$EHOME"
    # cd "$EHOME"
    # tar xzf <download-dir>/E-<platform>-<version>.tar.gz
    #


                     Automatic Install


If you are on one of the platforms for which automatic install is
supported (currently, only MSWindows, and only from an account with
Administrator privileges), then...

Launch the e.jar file. If your Java installation is fully functional,
you should be able to do this by double clicking on the e.jar file.
However, with this method there may be no console window, in which
case problems won't be visible. So if you suspect there may have been
a problem (most commonly because you didn't get the confirm monologue
box as explained below) we instead recommend typing
"java -jar e.jar" or its equivalent into your shell.

For example, in an MSDOS Shell:
    C:\Program Files\erights.org>java -jar e.jar
    E 0.8.22c Installer...
    Installing E on Windows...
    cp ...
... Click on "Ok" on the confirm monologue box ...
    E version: 0.8.22c at C:/Program Files/erights.org
    on Java version: 1.4.1_02 at c:/j2sdk1.4.1_02/jre
    on OS: Windows 2000 version: 5.0 on x86 (win32/x86)
    for Administrator in US
    C:\Program Files\erights.org>


For example, on Cygwin:
    $ "$JAVACMD" -jar e.jar
    Installing E...
    E 0.8.22c Installer...
    Installing E on Windows...
    cp ...
... Click on "Ok" on the confirm monologue box ...
    E version: 0.8.22c at C:/Program Files/erights.org
    on Java version: 1.4.1_02 at c:/j2sdk1.4.1_02/jre
    on OS: Windows 2000 version: 5.0 on x86 (win32/x86)
    for Administrator in US
    $


At the end of your session (before the last prompt) you should see a
confirm monologue box welcoming you to E and letting you know that E
is successfully installed. When you hit OK or dismiss this window, you
should see the kind of version information shown above.

After installation, you should see the following additional files
added to the install directory:

   eprops.txt     This file contains E configuation properties
   rune           This is a bash driver script for E
   winfo.txt      Records info about your system

If installation fails, you can try removing these three files and
trying again.


Installation makes some plausible default choices for you, which it
records in the eprops.txt file. You can change these choices to your
liking by editing eprops.txt (it's commented),
WRONG: and then either double click on the scripts/setup.e-awt file or run
WRONG:
WRONG:     % java -jar e.jar scripts/setup.e-awt
WRONG:
WRONG: to put your installation preferences into effect. (In the future, we
WRONG: plan to prompt with these choices, and allow editing, before putting
WRONG: them into effect.)
XXX Something like the above WRONG stuff should be made to work.


                     Manual Install


If you are on a platform for which Automatic Install isn't supported,
or if for some reason it isn't working for you, then...

Manually copy "eprops-template.txt" to "eprops.txt", copy
"rune-template.txt" to "rune", optionally copy "devrune-template.txt"
to "devrune", optionally copy "rune-bat-template.txt" to "rune.bat", and
then replace all text of the form "${{<property name>}}" in these new
files according to the comments at those places.

To ease manual installation, some of the entries in the these files
list default values as their value rather than a "${{..}}" form. After
copying these files, you don't need to edit these, but you may.

E scripts by convention begin with "#!/usr/bin/env rune". So if you wish
to run E scripts directly as executables, you will need to have
"/usr/bin/env" installed on your system. This looks on your PATH for its
argument, so you will need to copy or symlink the "rune" driver script
(made in the previous step) into your path. For a system install under
*nix, we recommend "/usr/local/bin/rune". For a personal install under
*nix, we recommend "~/bin/rune". For installing under Windows2K or
WindowsXP, we recommend "c:/Windows/rune".

"rune" is a bash script, and requires a bash >= 2.01 to be installed
as "bash" on your PATH so "#!/usr/bin/env bash" can find it. To check
your bash version, type

    $ echo $BASH_VERSION

into a bash shell. If you can't find an adequate bash for your system,
you can still run E scripts the old fashioned way, as explained below
under "Running E".

When doing a manual install, don't worry about "winfo.txt", it isn't
relevant. (It's only for helping the automatic installer, and to
supplement bug reports.)

Finally, each user of E, if they may be interested in running capDesk,
should make a copy of the <EHOME>/caplets directory at ~/caplets.


SWT on Linux:

We are currently experiencing a strange bug on one installation of Red
Hat Linux ("X Error of failed request: BadFont (invalid font
parameter)"), but we don't have the problem on another Red Hat
installation, and we haven't had the opportunity to try it on any
other Linuxes. If you have any information about this bug, please let
us know. Thanks.

If you get an error message about a file named libXm.so.2, then see
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-swt-home/faq.html#missinglibXm
for more on this issue.




                         Running E


Once E in installed you can run E scripts without using bash and
without SWT support by saying

    $ cd "$EHOME"
    $ java -jar e.jar <script>.<ext> <args...>

or without bash and with SWT support by saying

    $ cd "$EHOME"
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="bin/$OSDIR/$MACHDIR/"
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ java -cp "e.jar:bin/$OSDIR/swt.jar" \
    > "-Djava.library.path=bin/$OSDIR/$MACHDIR/" \
    > org.erights.e.elang.interp.Rune <script>.<ext> <args...>

where $OSDIR is, for example, "win32" or "linux-motif", $MACHDIR is,
for example "x86", and "<script>.<ext>" is the file name of the E
script. Any args following the script name are provided as arguments
to the script by the E expression "interp.getArgs()".

On MSWindows, the colon (":") shown above after the "e.jar" should
instead be a semicolon (";").

If you succeed at an automatic install, you should also be able to run
E scripts by double clicking on them. The right button menu should
give you more choices as well.

If you have a bash >= 2.01 installed on your system you can use it
to run scripts simply by:

    % rune <script>.<ext> <args...>

or, if the script begins with

    #!/usr/bin/env rune

and is executable (as E scripts should be), and you have
"/usr/bin/env" installed on your system (as all *nix systems seem to
these days), then you can simply say

    % <script>.<ext> <args...>

On some versions of Cygwin, putting the "#!/usr/bin/env rune" at the
top of the file makes it executable.

For more on running the "rune" driver bash script, type

    $ rune --help

or see the file "rune-help.txt".
