/**
 * An Ejector implements a non-local exit construct that can return a value.
 * <p/>
 * It works with an EscapeExpr to cause an escape to take place. When used
 * directly from Java, a typical pattern is:
 * <pre>
 *      Ejector ejector = new Ejector();
 *      //cause ejector to be appropriately accessible from the try
 *      //block
 *      try {
 *          //blah blah blah
 *          if (we need to exit) {
 *              ejector.run(result);
 *          }
 *          //blah blah blah
 *      } catch (Ejection ej) {
 *          Object result = ejector.result(ej);
 *      } finally {
 *          ejector.disable();
 *      }</pre>
